## User Story
As an individual who loves to read

I want to be able to search for different titles that interest me and save them to a reading list

So that I can reference this list and delete the books as they are read 

## Description and Usage

In the Search bar, type the title of a book you are interested in reading and click the 'Submit Book' button. A list of books with the specified title or similar title will appear with the following information:

Click the 'Save' button next to the book in which you would like to save to your personalized reading list.
